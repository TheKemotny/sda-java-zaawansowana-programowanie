After a little while, while, while, my dog, dog, dog starts to get tired, tired, tired so we sit down, sit down, sit down on a bench, bench, bench to rest, rest, rest. As we're sitting there, there, there, I notice a group of children, children, children playing, playing, playing in a nearby park, park, park.

It's so nice, nice, nice to see them having fun, fun, fun and laughing, laughing, laughing together. I feel grateful, grateful, grateful for this beautiful day, day, day and all the simple, simple, simple pleasures it brings, brings, brings.
